## Description

Eat-the-Burger is a simple web app that allows you to send information to a database. The user is able to create a "burger" with a name and send it to the database. After that they are able to "devour it" or make another burger of the
same type. When a "get in by belly" or "make another" button is clicked, a set statement is sent to the SQL database, changing wether the burger is eaten or not. Once the information is updated, the page is reloaded to show the effect of the button click.
